#TECH CHECK 4 - Dungeon Attack!!
#Description:   Write a program that asks the user to enter a hit point total between 1-200, prints a snarky 
#               error message on wrong entry while prompting again, and then attacks the user with monsters stored in 
#               a monsters.csv file until the user’s character is dead (i.e. 0 hit points) while reporting the 
#               results of each attack. An even snarkier message gets printed when the user’s character has died.
